Project Outline (20%):

What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else? What will your project do?

I will be developing a web application that functions as a project management tool specifically tailored for software development teams. This web app will facilitate users in organizing tasks, tracking progress, and collaborating effectively within their teams throughout the software development lifecycle. Key functionalities will include task creation, assignment tracking, and real-time updates, allowing team members to stay aligned from prototyping stages to final presentations. The application will incorporate interactive technologies, including HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, which will enable smooth user interactions and a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Additionally, this tool will include customizable project boards, team messaging capabilities, and visual progress tracking, all within an accessible and user-friendly interface. By focusing on the needs of software development teams, this project aims to streamline the process and provide a structured, organized platform to support both individual and collaborative work.

Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?

I chose to work on this project because of my experiences in both hackathons and a recent internship, where I encountered the challenges of project alignment and progress monitoring firsthand. During these experiences, I often found it difficult to keep track of tasks, stay aligned with team goals, and maintain clear communication with managers and teammates. By creating a centralized platform for project management, I aim to address these common challenges. Developing a tool that combines ease of use with essential features will allow users to focus on their tasks rather than worrying about organizational issues, ultimately improving productivity and team cohesion. This motivation stems from a desire to provide a comprehensive, efficient solution that simplifies project management for software developers.

Who is the target audience of this app? Be specific about the demographic (age/occupation), and the type of devices they might use.

The target audience for this project management app includes students and professionals in software development, consulting, or related fields like business analytics. This demographic typically ranges from ages 18 to 40 and includes individuals who are familiar with technology and work in collaborative environments. These users will primarily access the app on computers, as it will be a web-based platform; however, the app will be designed to work smoothly on both desktop and laptop devices. Secondary access could include tablets or mobile browsers, making the app accessible for team members who may be on the go. This tool will benefit those who require an organized approach to project management, specifically those in roles that involve multi-step workflows, such as engineers, analysts, and consultants, who need a clear overview of tasks, deadlines, and collaboration features.

What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your app?

This project aims to tackle common challenges in project management, particularly in software development. Issues like miscommunication, lack of organization, and alignment difficulties are often sources of delays and inefficiencies in team projects. My web app will solve these problems by providing an integrated space for task management, team communication, and progress tracking. With these tools in place, users can reduce misunderstandings, stay updated on each other’s work, and maintain momentum throughout their projects. By keeping essential features in a single app, users won’t need to switch between platforms to manage tasks, leading to a more focused and productive environment. The final product will benefit users by simplifying project management and enhancing team communication, which ultimately increases the efficiency of the development process and reduces the risk of project delays.

Identify the programming language(s) you will need to learn in order to work on this project. Provide a link to the official documentation for this programming language. Also, provide 3 free, easy-to-access resources that you can use to learn this programming language.

I will primarily be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. JavaScript, in particular, will be essential for adding interactivity and functionality to the web application.
